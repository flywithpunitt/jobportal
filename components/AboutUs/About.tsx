                  The genesis of our journey lies in the aspirations of two
                  visionary and enthusiastic friends who were always driven by
                  the desire to revolutionize how people find employment and
                  secure their livelihoods. Their goal wasn't merely financial
                  gain but rather the accumulation of blessings earned by
                  positively impacting individuals' lives.

                    Pooling our collective efforts, we formed a dedicated team
                    that brought forth wiztrace.com, a platform with a profound
                    mission and unbridled enthusiasm. Despite working within
                    tight constraints, we tirelessly poured energy into crafting
                    this distinctive platform. This endeavour took place against
                    the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic when the world
                    underwent an unprecedented change from what it had been just
                    a year prior. During this challenging period, the
                    distressing scenes of migrant workers fleeing cities due to
                    the pandemic-induced uncertainty and chaos deeply moved us.
                    In response, we began assisting those within our immediate
                    vicinity. As our commitment grew and the need to aid a
                    larger demographic became evident, the transition into a
                    formal company was a logical step. This marked the birth of
                    Wiztrace. Our vision expanded beyond addressing the
                    employment concerns of the educated; it extended to
                    providing substantial opportunities to those with limited
                    education or no formal training. And all of this without
                    imposing any financial burden on job seekers.
